3. What is SVG?
ANS.:        SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics
             SVG is used to define vector-based graphics for the Web
             SVG defines the graphics in XML format





4. What is difference between HTML and XHTML?
ANS.:        HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.

5. What are logical and physical tags in HTML?
ANS.:        Logical tags are used to provide information by giving the special importance to the text.
             For example, <em> tag is used to emphasize the text by representing it in italic format.
             Physical tags are used to style the content only.

8. Canvas and SVG tags 
ANS.:        SVG is Vector based (composed of shapes).
             SVG gives better performance with smaller number of objects or larger surface.
             SVG can be modified through script and CSS.
             SVG has better scalability. So it can be printed with high quality at any resolution.

             Canvas is Raster based (composed of pixel).
             Canvas gives better performance with smaller surface or larger number of objects.
             Canvas can be modified through script only.
             Canvas has poor scalability. Hence it is not suitable for printing on higher resolution.
